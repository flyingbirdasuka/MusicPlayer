This Music Player, with my original music, is made by using only vanilla javascript without any additional libraries besides font-awesome for design purposes.

You can go to the next / previous song by clicking the arrows when there are no more songs then the arrow will be disabled.

It can be fast-forwarding or rewinding by clicking the progress bar then the music and time will be automatically updated.
